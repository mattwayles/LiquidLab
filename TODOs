============================ BUGS / CLEANUP ================================
============================================================================

===== LIQUIDLAB =====
- Clicking logo should take you back to root
- Ensure "Making" a recipe properly depletes new PG/VG/NIC inventory
- Make Target PG/VG/NIC red if I don't have enough in inventory!
- On user create, set default weight & default base ingredients

===== INVENTORY =====
- Bottom buttons need spacing
- Pasting data into Amount Left results in NaN and an error

===== SHOPPING LIST =====
- Set and close are too close
- Ensure PG/VG/NIC are applied

===== WEIGHTS =====
- Set and Close button are too close
- Ensure database commit works correctly, big changes were made without being tested.

===== DIALOGS =====
- Material-UI dialog buttons don't conform to the rest of app. Pick one and stick with it.
