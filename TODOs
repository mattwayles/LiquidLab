============================================ BUGS / CLEANUP ============================================================
========================================================================================================================

===== ADD FLV TO INVENTORY =====
- Do I want this table to be sortable? Probably, to conform to the rest of the app (ugh). This also means I need to update nonInventoryValue via flavor name, not index.
- Add ToolTips to this new, flashy table.


===== RESULTS =====
- This grid should be sortable by each column. I may need to convert into Material-UI Table first, but follow the template set in Inventory to complete


===== LIQUIDLAB =====
- Success message 'drawer', grow open, shrink closed
- Split notes into description (public) / notes (private) in anticipation of Global Recipes
- Expand AutoComplete capabilities in InputOption to actually populate the textbox with the top result.
- Sub-directories for each batch under the same name (So I'm not populating recipe list with a ton of different batches of the same recipe)
- Warn when token is about to expire, allow user to re-up
- Better logout acknowledgement
- "I Made This" scroll to top
- TO DOs!
- Either add image onto main screen (if authenticated), or add image preview to AddImage dialog. I don't like three dialog message showing up when overwriting a recipe.
- Clean up the code. Extract util methods into smaller, more logical methods. Pull logical code out of classes into util.
    Stop doing the same thing three different ways, analyze the inputs/outputs and write reusable functions accordingly.
- Mobile / Tablet / Responsive Optimization (Mobile- snap to top when updating DB so success message can be seen!)
