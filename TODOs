============================ BUGS / CLEANUP ================================
============================================================================

===== LIQUIDLAB =====
- Modify Overwrite dialog to allow user to either Continue or Create New
- Success message 'drawer', grow open, shrink closed
- Warning message when calculating recipe with invalid inputs
- Sub-directories for each batch under the same name (So I'm not populating recipe list with a ton of different batches of the same recipe)

===== INVENTORY =====
- On plus button click, open the Vendor textbox to await data input
- Tab button in base should move to next base ingredient
- # of Recipes is not updating correctly
- Inventory flavor ID is not incrementing, but it doesn't seem to affect much; do I need a flavor ID?

===== ADD FLV TO INVENTORY =====
- When adding flavor to inventory, present a grid with amount to add. Give user the chance to input flavor amount there, instead of it adding at 0ml


===== RESULTS =====
- Maybe alphabetize? Or alphabetize when database I/O? Do users want alphabetization?
